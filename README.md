# Wifi QR Code Decoder

Android phones don't allow users to check passwords of saved wifi networks.  
But they allow to "share" currently connected network with QR code, which shares the password in a plaintext form.

This is a simple web app that reads and displays wifi passwords from such qr codes, either from photos or directly from device's camera.
